RANAT: Towards Cleaner and Brighter India is a smart solar tracking system developed by undergraduate students of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Sai Vidya Institute of Technology, Bengaluru. The project focuses on maximizing the efficiency of solar panels through a dual-axis tracking mechanism that automatically aligns the solar panel to the direction of maximum sunlight using LDR (Light Dependent Resistors) and IR sensors. The system is designed to intelligently monitor light intensity, adjust panel position using motors, and prevent motion during obstructions. What sets RANAT apart is the integration of an Energy Storage System (ESS) that utilizes lithium-ion battery technology to store excess energy generated during peak sunlight hours for future use. The setup is further enhanced with IoT-based monitoring using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and ThingSpeak, allowing real-time tracking and data logging of solar voltage output.

This cost-effective solution demonstrates up to 35% efficiency improvement using single-axis tracking, and an additional 3% with dual-axis movement compared to fixed solar panels. It also emphasizes sustainability by reducing carbon emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy. The system is modular, low-maintenance, and built using affordable components, making it ideal for both domestic and educational applications. The project also explores the scope of integrating self-cleaning coatings, AI-based predictive tracking, and hybrid energy harvesting methods like TENGs and TEGs for future development. The successful implementation of RANAT showcases how embedded systems, renewable energy technologies, and IoT can come together to create impactful solutions aligned with Indiaâ€™s sustainable energy goals.
